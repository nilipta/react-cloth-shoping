The Jordan Mars 270 London boasts a mesh grid inspired by MJ's first global release and a soft leather overlay for added durability—while a special LDN hangtag finishes things off in defiant style."

Along with its both iridescent and reflective uppers, the pair set itself apart amongst the vast range of standouts, and Jordan Brand was very obviously aware of this as they quickly confirmed a sequel for 2020. Now, only moments out from this very release, the pair has just hit official images after many a tease months ago, showcasing the new, more vibrant approach of White and the titular “Racer Blue.”",
